<h2>TECHNOLOGY : </h2></br>
<h3>1. HTML5 : </h3>
<p>HTML5 is the fifth version of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a standard language used 
to structure webpages. It defines how content on a webpage should be structured and displayed. </p>

<h3>2. CSS3 :</h3>
<p>CSS3 stands for Cascading Style Sheets Level 3. It is an advanced version of CSS, used for 
structuring, styling, and formatting web pages. CSS3 introduces several new features and is 
supported by all modern web browsers.</p>

<h3>3. Vanilla JAVASCRIPT </h3>
<p>Vanilla JavaScript simply means plain, native JavaScript‚Äîthe version of JavaScript that runs 
directly in the browser without any libraries or frameworks like React, jQuery, Angular, or Vue.</p>

<h3>4. TheMealDB API </h3>
<p>TheMealDB API is a free and open online database of food recipes and meal data. It is widely 
used by developers building recipe apps, cooking guides, and meal-planning platforms. </p>

 <h1>Performance </h1>
<h3>üüß Responsive Design </h3>
<p>The application is built with a mobile-first responsive layout using flexible CSS media queries and 
scalable UI components. It ensures seamless user experience across various screen sizes including 
smartphones, tablets, and desktops. The interface adapts dynamically without loss of functionality 
or visual consistency, allowing users to interact smoothly regardless of their device. </p>

<h3>üüß Instant API Response Handling </h3>
<p>The integration with TheMealDB API is optimized to handle real-time requests efficiently. API 
calls are executed asynchronously using JavaScript‚Äôs fetch() with proper loading indicators. This 
ensures that users receive recipe data almost instantly after making a query. The system also 
includes error-handling mechanisms to manage failed requests gracefully without crashing the 
interface. </p>
<h3>üüß Smooth Transitions </h3>
<p>Smooth visual transitions and animations are implemented to enhance user experience. Elements 
such as modals, menu toggles, dark mode switches, and content loading animations are rendered 
using CSS transitions and keyframes. These smooth effects improve the perceived performance 
and polish of the application, making interactions feel fluid and modern. </p>
